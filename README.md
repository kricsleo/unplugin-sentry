[![NPM version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/unplugin-sentry?color=a1b858&label=)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/unplugin-sentry)

All-in-one plugin for Sentry, supports webpack, vite, rollup, nuxt .ect.

It's used to upload sourcemap and release your project to Sentry ([What's Sentry?](https://sentry.io/welcome/)).

## Features

- ü™ú Supports multiple bundlers and frameworks, including webpack, vite, rollup, nuxt and so on.
- ‚ú® Auto-detect configs depending on current environment.
- üßπ Auto clean local soucemap files after upload (For security).
- üç¨ Optional runtime provided, easy to init Sentry at runtime.

## Install

```bash
npm i unplugin-sentry -D
```

<details>
<summary>Vite</summary><br>

```ts
// vite.config.ts
import unpluginSentry from 'unplugin-sentry/vite'

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [
    unpluginSentry({ /* options */ }),
  ],
})
```

Example: [`playground/vite`](./playground/vite)

<br></details>

<details>
<summary>Rollup</summary><br>

```ts
// rollup.config.js
import unpluginSentry from 'unplugin-sentry/rollup'

export default {
  plugins: [
    unpluginSentry({ /* options */ }),
  ],
}
```

Example: [`playground/rollup`](./playground/rollup)

<br></details>


<details>
<summary>Webpack</summary><br>

```ts
// webpack.config.js
module.exports = {
  /* ... */
  plugins: [
    require('unplugin-sentry/webpack')({ /* options */ })
  ]
}
```

Example: [`playground/webpack`](./playground/webpack)

> This module works for Webpack >= 3

<br></details>

<details>
<summary>Nuxt</summary><br>

```ts
// nuxt.config.js
export default {
  buildModules: [
    ['unplugin-sentry/nuxt', { /* options */ }],
  ],
}
```

Example: [`playground/nuxt`](./playground/nuxt)

> This module works for both Nuxt 2 and [Nuxt Vite](https://github.com/nuxt/vite)

<br></details>

<details>
<summary>Vue CLI</summary><br>

```ts
// vue.config.js
module.exports = {
  configureWebpack: {
    plugins: [
      require('unplugin-sentry/webpack')({ /* options */ }),
    ],
  },
}
```

<br></details>

<details>
<summary>esbuild</summary><br>

I don't use esbuild for now, so it haven't been tested in esbuild yet.
(You can have a try and tell me if it works üëÇ. )

<br></details>

## Runtime Support

Besides uploading sourcemap to Sentry and other publishing works, this plugin also injects a virtual module named `virtual-unplugin-sentry-runtime` into your project. 

It provides some useful meta info when initing Sentry at runtime. For example, when you call `Sentry.init({/** options **/})`, the `environment` and `release` options must match the one you use when uploading sourcemap. So that when debugging the issue in Sentry, the sourcemap can be correctly mapped.

```ts
import * as sentryMeta from 'virtual-unplugin-sentry-runtime'

console.log(sentryMeta)
// {
//   ORG: string
//   PROJECT: string
//   ENV: string
//   RELEASE: string
//   PUBLISH: boolean
// }
```

Need TS support for this runtime module? Just add the following config to your `tsconfig.json`.

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "types": ["unplugin-sentry/runtime"]
  }
}
```
